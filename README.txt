Description:
   This bundle contains a highlighting for diff files
   (also called patches) created with diff,
   subversion or whatever.
   It should colorize the normal, context and unified diff
   format, as well as some subversion extras.
   It is created after what I found on the attached URL and
   what 'svn diff' produces.
